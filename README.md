## âœ¨ Calculator

The project [Calculator](https://bogdanblare.github.io/Calculator/) is a web-based calculator application. It provides users with a convenient and user-friendly interface to perform mathematical calculations online.

The calculator interface is designed to resemble a traditional handheld calculator, with a set of buttons representing numbers, arithmetic operators, and other functions. Users can input their calculations by clicking on the buttons or by using their keyboard.

The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes additional functionalities like percentage calculation and square root computation, which can be accessed through the corresponding buttons on the interface.

The calculator provides immediate feedback by displaying the input expression and the calculated result in real-time. This allows users to review their calculations and make adjustments as needed.

The project is implemented using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it accessible through a web browser without the need for any additional installations. It offers a responsive design, allowing users to access and utilize the calculator on different devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones.
